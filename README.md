# Proposal

## Data Set

We have selected the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) maintained database of sightings of Unidentified flying objects. We will deal specifically with reports made in British Columbia, Canada before 11/18/2020. While NURFORC does currate reports and remove obvious hoaxes, the data is submitted by users and in the majority of cases presented in the users's own words.

## Primary Question

Our primary questions is inferential: Is the mean duration of sightings of UFOs of different shapes different?

## Analysis Plan

Our main tool for this analysis will be a statistical hypotheisis test. We will likely use an ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test like Tukey's HSD in order to answer the question. As a part of our exploratory analysis, we will create a violin plot of duration of sighting seperated by each shape. We will also create a table for summary statistics seperated by sighting.

## Report Structure

We will ultimately present a report but we will introduce the individual violin plots of particularly interesting shapes before ultimatley reporducing the EDA model, but with confidence intervals. We will also produce a table with the results of our Tukey's HSD and ANOVA in a neat and elegant fashion to further make our point.
