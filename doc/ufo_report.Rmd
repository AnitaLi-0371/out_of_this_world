# Summary

# Introduction

Unidentified flying objects (UFOS) have a long and somewhat contentious history. Contrary to popular belief, most sightings are actually honest mistakes and not hoaxes. Weather balloons, satellites, and other explicable phenomena account for the vast majority of sightings. We wondered if these different phenomenon might leave traces in the data. Suspecting that different causes would be associated with different shapes of UFO reported in the sighting, we thought that these different causes might lead to different duration of sightings in our home areas of Washington and British Columbia. 

## Data

```{r}
ufo_raw <- read_csv("../data/raw/aliens.csv")
ufo_tidy <- read_csv("../data/processed/aliens.csv")
```

To test our hypothesis, we selected the dataset UFO sightings maintained by National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). The data is submitted by users and in the majority of cases presented in the users' own words. For analysis, we have selected reports made in British Columbia, Canada and Washington State, USA before 11/18/2020. There are `r nrow(ufo_raw)` observations and `r ncol(ufo_raw)` features in the data set.

### Data Processing

Text reports of sightings were converted to seconds. We removed sightings that had approximate times or provided a range of times for example: `still here`, `seconds`, `unknown`, `some minutes`. Reports that did not specify any shape or specified something other than shape, for example `Flash`, `Light`, `Unknown`, `Other`, `Changing`, were removed. We also applied a log-transform to the duration of sightings in seconds to aid in visualizing our data and to help make the results of our testing more interpretable. The final data used in the analysis has `r nrow(ufo_tidy)` observations.

## Analysis

**Hypothesis**

-   $H_0$ The median population log duration of all the shapes are equal

-   $H_A$ The median population log duration of all the shapes are equal

We took a non-parametric approach because of differences in group size, skewed distribution even after transformation, and variance between the different duration of different shapes. We selected the Kruskal-Wallis H Test to test to determine if significant differences existed. Dunn's test was utilized for Post-Hoc analysis with Bonferroni's correction to identify pairs of groups whose median population duration are significantly different. We selected a significance level of $\alpha =0.05$ for both steps in testing.

# Results & Discussion

**EDA** ![](../results/ufo_duration_distribution.png)

**Kruskal Wallis H Test**

```{r}
kw_test <- readRDS(here::here("results", "KW.rds"))
kw_cap <- "Table 1. Kruskal Wallis H Test Test Results"
knitr::kable(kw_test, caption = kw_cap)
```

**P value of significant pairs from Dunn Test**

```{r}
summary <- readRDS(here::here("results", "summary_shape.rds"))
summary_cap <- "Table 2. Summary"
knitr::kable(summary, caption = summary_cap)
```

**Post-Hoc Analysis Result**

Ultimately, our testing revealed several significant differences in log median duration between shapes. Further experimentation will be necessary to confirm if this is, in fact, due to different underlying causes. 

Additionally, there are some important limitations to this work. As discussed in previous sections we removed a good deal of data in processing. There is potential that we somehow skewed our results through this process. Furthermore, our sample was not random or representative of all UFO sightings in the BC and Washington area because we only had access to samples that were reported.
